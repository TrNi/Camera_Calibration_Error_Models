## 🚀 Features

✅ Estimate systematic bias errors in camera intrinsics & extrinsics (Eq. 11)  
✅ Compute bias ratio (Eq. 12) to detect potential model mismatches  
✅ Detector noise estimation via robust per-board group splitting (Eq. 10)  
✅ Calculate standard covariance from the calibration Jacobian (Eq. 8)  
✅ Full nonparametric bootstrap & approximated bootstrap uncertainty estimation (Eqs. 13–15, 19–20)  
✅ Mapping error residuals and expected mapping error (EME) evaluation (Eqs. 22–24)  
✅ Modular design with direct correspondence to mathematical formulations in peer-reviewed literature  
✅ Easily extendable for distortion models, fisheye, stereo rigs, or multi-camera systems


## 📚 Theory

This library implements equations and algorithms described in:

> Hagemann et al., **Inferring Bias and Uncertainty in Camera Calibration** with consistent math and notations.

Each function is traceable to specific equations (e.g., `compute_bias_ratio` → Eq. 12) with consistent notation.



## 📷 Applications

- Assessing calibration quality in robotics, AR/VR, autonomous driving, and SLAM
- Detecting systematic calibration errors in automated pipelines
- Comparing calibration performance across datasets, devices, or algorithms
- Research into robust and uncertainty-aware camera calibration



## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! We’re actively seeking:

- New error models or uncertainty estimators
- Support for advanced distortion (e.g., fisheye, omnidirectional)
- Benchmarks on different calibration datasets
